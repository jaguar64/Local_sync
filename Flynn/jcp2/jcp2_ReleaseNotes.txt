jcp History
-----------
There are 5 jcp source packages, and hereafter a brief summary

1) The Removers jcp version doesn't handle the Skunkboard v3 (or at least they do not display options to handle it)
-- They have added support for the Skunk console communication, but I do not know yet if such addition has been done in Tursi code as well
-- At a point, in 2012, The Removers stopped to update their jcp and missed the changes/fixes done 6 months later by Tursi/A31Chris
2) The jcp version in the skunkboard.zip is the oldest jcp source code I've found
3) The Skunkboard_full_release.zip file contains the newest / most recent jcp source code releases (dated from the 12th August 2012)
-- jcp2 is based on this source code
